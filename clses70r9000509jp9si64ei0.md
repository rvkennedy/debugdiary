Sadly, and obscurely, Qt's QProcessEnvironment can't change the running environment. If you call QProcessEnvironment::systemEnvironment(), that returns the current environment *by value*. Any changes you make to the returned object are discarded. You must instead use \_putenv() to change environment variables.
