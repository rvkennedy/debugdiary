If your keyboard in Windows ever just stops working, but it's clearly not a hardware problem as you can still log-in - it just doesn't work once you have - look for an icon in the bottom-right (the notification area) called FilterKeys.

Double-click the icon, turn off all its nonsense, and the keyboard should start working again.
